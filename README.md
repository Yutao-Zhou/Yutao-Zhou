### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Yutao Zhou
#### I am student at UCSB
I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Physics at UCSB and will graduate in December 2021. After that, I plan to pursue Electrical or Computer Engineering or Computer Science for my Master of Science degree. With the belief that Physics is the discipline that studies how the universe functions, I chose Physics as my undergraduate major to lay a solid academic foundation. UCSBâ€™s abundant educational resources allow me to explore broadly in the physical field, from fundamental physics to theoretical physics and experimental physics, while building my mathematical strength. In graduate school, I would love to learn programming and electronic knowledge. These would be the cornerstone for my future career plan. It would not be more fantastic if I could become an automobile electronics engineer both in the software and hardware aspect in the future to design automotive circuits freely and optimize car performance constantly. I am also passionate about AI, more specifically autonomous driving. With the advanced education that I will get from your university and my effort, I will found my dream company to pursue my dream of changing human life.
